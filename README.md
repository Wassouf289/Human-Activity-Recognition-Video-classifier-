# Human-activity-recognition-video-classifier-

A model that predicts the activity being performed by a human in a video.

The Dataset used is the Youtube UCF50 â€“ Action Recognition Dataset,I used only a part from the dataset with 10 actions:

Drumming - Biking - Basketball - Diving - Billiards - HorseRiding - Mixing - PushUps - Skiing - Swing

we tried with two models:

1- Model_1: Convolutional neural networks with pretrained model VGG16 (64*64*3)

2- Model_2: used the same previous model with Bidirectional LSTM

only the first model provided in Github, the second model isn't , due to large size, please contact me if you want to get it.
